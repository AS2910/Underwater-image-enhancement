# Underwater-image-enhancement
This contents the code for Enhancing underwater images , which was a part of my course, where in I have executed the task with the help 
of the following research paper:
Color Balance and Fusion for Underwater Image Enhancement by Codruta O. Ancuti , Cosmin Ancuti, Christophe De Vleeschouwer , and 
Philippe Bekaert published in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOL. 27, NO. 1, JANUARY 2018.
The code for the same is done using MATLAB, and is in the file named code.m, and the images used for testing are included in the images folder.
